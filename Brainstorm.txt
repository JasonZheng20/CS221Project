Brainstorm Ideas

Directions:
We want to create a project based around something that has a lot of training data
1. Music Based
  -Classifying Genres
  -Guess if user likes a song
  -Chatbot recommend songs
  -(***)Application with seed playlist of songs
    -Classify alot of songs into genres, or create a tool to determine similarity between songs
    -metadata on songs from itunes or spodify
    -Start with a playlist of songs
    -Based on whether user likes songs or not (weighted skipping/rating)
      -Determine more songs to add to the playlist
      -Extra: (be able to export playlist)
            -be able to do it just from listening to music, not knowing the song and its metadata
2. Image Based
  -Recycling classifier
  -Classify location given pictures
  -Cuisine Classifier
  -Restaurant Recommender
  -Instagram best photo
3. NLP Based
  -Paper to Copy/Pastable text
  -Chrome Extension, relevance to essay of random webpages detector/scorer


Alternative:
4. ML-based tutorer
